                    <li><strong>1901</strong> - Born in Soerabaja</li>

                    <li><strong>1930</strong> - Soekarno was sentenced to four years in prison, which were served in Sukamiskin prison in Bandung.

Throughout the morning, impromptu leaflets printed by PETA and youth elements informed the population of the impending proclamation. Finally, at 10 am, Soekarno and Hatta stepped to the front porch, where Soekarno declared the independence of the Republic of Indonesia in front of a crowd of 500 people.
